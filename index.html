    <p>Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential. Take WordPress. At this point, WordPress is a pretty big project. If a core developer wanted to work on one specific part of the WordPress codebase, it wouldn’t be safe or efficient to have them directly edit the “official” source code.</p>
